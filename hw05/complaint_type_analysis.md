- Staten Island: 139 complaints

## Key Findings

Heating complaints dropped by 74,930 complaints from Jan-Feb to Jun-Jul, representing a 91.62% decrease.

This makes sense because people need heat in winter (Jan-Feb) but not in summer (Jun-Jul). The pattern is consistent across all boroughs - the Bronx has the most heating complaints in both periods, and Staten Island has the least.

The huge drop shows that heating complaints are very seasonal and mostly happen during cold months.
